# Salesforce Field Permission

Mass update field permissions for different objects in field sets.

## Overview

If you spent a lot of time setting field permission in permission sets, this extension is for you!

This extension uses [Salesforce CLI](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode) and [JSforce](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce) to mass update field permissions for different objects in field sets directly in your VS Code using authenticated orgs from salesforce cli.

You can set org and permission sets as default and when you open the page these settings are pre-filled and you can use less clicks (and time :wink:).
